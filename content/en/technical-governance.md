## Documentation-First Engineering

This project was built using a **Documentation-First** approach, where comprehensive governance documents, architecture specifications, and engineering standards were written before and during development. These documents served as the foundation for both human decision-making and AI-assisted implementation.

### The Philosophy

Rather than writing code first and documenting later, this project inverts the traditional workflow:

1. **Define Intent** — Engineering standards, architecture decisions, and governance principles are captured in markdown documents
2. **Establish Governance** — Clear rules, quality gates, and decision-making frameworks are documented
3. **Build with Guidance** — Code is written with these documents as the source of truth, ensuring consistency and alignment
4. **AI as Co-Pilot** — AI tools (like [Cursor](https://cursor.com)) use these documents to understand context, make informed suggestions, and maintain architectural integrity

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD) in Practice

### Core Governance Documents

The project's technical governance is defined through several key documents:

#### Engineering Standards (`docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`)

A comprehensive **north-star** document that captures engineering intent across:

- **Architectural Foundations** — Modular, component-based architecture principles
- **Frontend Engineering Standards** — Code quality, component engineering, and design system guidelines
- **Accessibility (A11y)** — WCAG 2.1 AA targets, testing practices, and tooling
- **Security Hardening** — Runtime security, build-time checks, and authentication patterns
- **Performance & Web Vitals** — Core Web Vitals targets, Lighthouse thresholds, and optimization strategies
- **SEO & Discoverability** — Technical SEO, structured data, and content optimization
- **Testing Standards** — Unit, integration, and E2E testing expectations with coverage thresholds
- **Design System Standards** — Design tokens, component guidelines, and documentation practices

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for what "good" looks like in this codebase.

### Solution-Agnostic Policy, Constitution, and SDD

- **Supremacy**: `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` defines the immutable invariants and conflict-resolution precedence for this repo.
- Within those constraints, the machine-readable SDD at `/sdd.yaml` is authoritative for principles, boundaries, and CI expectations.
- Governance and standards are solution-agnostic: technology choices may evolve, but the principles must remain intact.
- Any change that affects architecture or cross-cutting concerns should update the SDD and relevant documentation in the same PR.

#### Architecture Overview (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

Defines the technical architecture including:

- System components and their relationships
- Technology stack decisions (Next.js, React, Tailwind, etc.)
- Content architecture (Markdown + Contentlayer)
- Deployment model (Vercel)
- Key data flows and integrations

#### Engineering Constitution (`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`)

Defines the repo’s **immutable invariants** and the governance **precedence order**.

- It is intentionally short and stable (MUST / MUST NOT / NEVER statements only).
- The SDD (`sdd.yaml`) and ADRs provide the changeable details and rationale.

#### Additional Governance Documents

- **Architecture Decision Records** (`docs/adr/`) — Lightweight records of architectural decisions with context, alternatives, and consequences
- **AI Guardrails** (`docs/AI_GUARDRAILS.md`) — AI coding rules, required practices, forbidden patterns, and review checklist
- **Design System** (`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) — Visual design tokens, component patterns, usage guidelines
- **Accessibility Guidelines** (`docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`) — Technical accessibility practices and tooling
- **SEO Guide** (`docs/SEO_GUIDE.md`) — SEO implementation patterns and best practices
- **Error Handling** (`docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md`) — Error boundaries, logging, and monitoring strategies
- **Security Policy** (`docs/SECURITY_POLICY.md`) — Security practices and vulnerability reporting

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

To complement the comprehensive documentation, this project uses **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** to capture significant architectural decisions with their context and consequences.

### Purpose

ADRs provide lightweight, searchable documentation that:

- **Captures Context** — Documents why decisions were made, not just what was implemented
- **Preserves Rationale** — Prevents future contributors from undoing good decisions
- **Shows Alternatives** — Records what options were considered and why they weren't chosen
- **Tracks Consequences** — Explicitly documents trade-offs and known limitations
- **Enables AI Context** — Provides structured architectural context for AI-assisted development

### When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions about:

- **Architecture changes** — System structure, boundaries, or patterns
- **Technology choices** — Adopting new libraries, frameworks, or tools
- **Cross-cutting concerns** — Error handling, logging, security, performance
- **Breaking changes** — API changes, contract modifications
- **Design patterns** — New patterns or deprecation of existing ones

See `docs/adr/README.md` for the complete ADR process and template.

### ADR Integration

ADRs integrate with the development workflow:

1. **Propose Decision** — Draft ADR with status "Proposed" before implementation
2. **Open PR** — Link to ADR in PR description
3. **Review Together** — Review both code and ADR
4. **Accept Decision** — Update ADR status to "Accepted" after merge
5. **Reference Later** — Future PRs and AI agents reference ADRs for context

## How AI-Assisted Development Works

### Context-Aware Development

With comprehensive documentation and ADRs in place, AI tools can:

1. **Understand Intent** — By reading `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`, AI understands the quality bar, architectural patterns, and coding standards
2. **Learn from Decisions** — By reading ADRs, AI understands past architectural decisions and their rationale
3. **Maintain Consistency** — When suggesting code, AI references the design system, accessibility guidelines, and testing standards
4. **Enforce Governance** — AI can flag deviations from documented standards and suggest corrections
5. **Generate Tests** — Testing expectations and coverage thresholds in the SDD/CI guide AI to generate appropriate test suites
6. **Document Decisions** — AI helps maintain documentation and write ADRs as code evolves

### Example Workflow

When implementing a new feature:

1. **Reference Standards** — AI reads `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` to understand component patterns, accessibility requirements, and testing expectations
2. **Review Past Decisions** — AI consults ADRs in `docs/adr/` to understand previous architectural choices and their rationale
3. **Check Architecture** — AI consults `ARCHITECTURE.md` to ensure the implementation aligns with system design
4. **Apply Design System** — AI uses `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` to suggest appropriate design tokens and component patterns
5. **Document Decision** — If the feature requires an architectural decision, AI helps draft an ADR
6. **Generate Tests** — AI creates tests that meet coverage thresholds enforced in the SDD/CI
7. **Maintain Documentation** — AI helps update relevant docs if the feature introduces new patterns

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Development

- **Faster Onboarding** — New contributors (human or AI) can understand the project quickly through documentation
- **Consistent Quality** — Standards are explicit, not implicit, reducing variance in code quality
- **Reduced Technical Debt** — Decisions are documented, making it easier to understand "why" and avoid regressions
- **Better AI Assistance** — AI tools have rich context to provide more accurate suggestions

### For Maintenance

- **Clear Decision History** — Architecture decisions are captured, not lost in commit messages
- **Easier Refactoring** — Understanding original intent helps make safe changes
- **Quality Gates** — CI/CD enforces documented standards automatically
- **Living Documentation** — Docs evolve with the codebase, staying current

### For Collaboration

- **Shared Understanding** — Everyone (including AI) works from the same source of truth
- **Explicit Trade-offs** — Decisions and their rationale are documented
- **Governance as Code** — Standards are version-controlled and reviewable
- **Transparency** — Project structure and quality expectations are clear

## Implementation Details

- **Reviewable** — Changes go through PR review
- **Linked** — Documents reference each other for context
- **Living** — Updated as the project evolves

## AI Governance Model

### Principles

This project embraces **AI-first development with strong guardrails**:

1. **AI as Accelerator, Not Decision Maker** — AI tools suggest implementations, but architectural decisions remain human-driven and documented
2. **Documentation as AI Context** — Comprehensive docs enable AI to understand intent and maintain consistency
3. **Quality Gates Are Non-Negotiable** — All AI-generated code must pass the same rigorous checks as human code
4. **Security Constraints Are Mandatory** — AI cannot bypass security controls or introduce vulnerabilities
5. **Human Oversight for Critical Changes** — Security-sensitive and architectural changes require manual review

### Responsibilities

**AI Tools (Copilot, Cursor):**

- Reference governance docs for context (`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`, `sdd.yaml`, `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Suggest code following documented patterns
- Generate tests meeting coverage requirements
- Update documentation when introducing new patterns
- Run validation checks before committing

**Human Reviewers:**

- Verify architectural alignment
- Assess security implications
- Validate maintainability
- Approve/reject AI suggestions
- Update governance docs as needed

**Automated CI/CD:**

- Enforce linting, type checking, test coverage
- Run security scans (CodeQL, dependency audits)
- Validate accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Check performance (Lighthouse budgets)
- Block merge on failures

### Guardrails and Constraints

**Mandatory guardrails** prevent AI from:

- Bypassing security controls (Turnstile, rate limiting, input validation)
- Weakening accessibility (keyboard nav, ARIA, color contrast)
- Violating architecture boundaries (cross-layer imports, shared mutable state)
- Introducing forbidden patterns (hard-coded secrets, unsanitized HTML, skipped tests)

**Quality gates** that all changes must pass:

- Linting (`pnpm lint`) and formatting (Prettier)
- Type checking (`pnpm typecheck`) in strict mode
- Unit tests with 90% line coverage
- E2E tests for user-facing changes
- Accessibility audit
- Security scanning (CodeQL, npm audit)
- Lighthouse performance ≥90, accessibility ≥90, SEO ≥95

See **[AI Guardrails](https://github.com/vicenteopaso/vicenteopaso-vibecode/blob/main/docs/AI_GUARDRAILS.md)** for complete constraints.

### Review Process

**All PRs** (AI or human) follow the same review workflow:

1. **Self-Review** — Author validates changes against [Review Checklist](https://github.com/vicenteopaso/vicenteopaso-vibecode/blob/main/docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
2. **CI Validation** — Automated checks must pass (see `.github/workflows/`)
3. **Human Review** — Architectural and security review (required for sensitive changes)
4. **Merge Decision** — Auto-merge eligible for safe changes, manual approval otherwise

**Auto-merge eligible** (with `copilot-automerge` label):

- Documentation-only changes
- Dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Test updates without behavior changes
- Formatting/linting fixes

**Requires manual review:**

- Security-related changes (API routes, auth, validation)
- Architecture changes (boundaries, patterns)
- Breaking changes
- New dependencies

### Escalation Path

**When things go wrong:**

1. **CI Failure** — Review logs, fix locally, re-run checks, push fixes
2. **Security Vulnerability** — Stop immediately, review [Security Policy](https://github.com/vicenteopaso/vicenteopaso-vibecode/blob/main/docs/SECURITY_POLICY.md), fix vulnerability, re-scan
3. **Accessibility Regression** — Review [Accessibility Guidelines](https://github.com/vicenteopaso/vicenteopaso-vibecode/blob/main/docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md), test with keyboard/screen reader, fix
4. **Architecture Violation** — Review `sdd.yaml` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`, refactor to align, get human approval

**Emergency stop conditions:**

- High/critical security vulnerabilities
- Production errors spike
- Severe accessibility breakage
- Data loss or corruption
- Secrets exposed in commits

**Escalation contacts:**

- Repository owner: @vicenteopaso
- Security issues: GitHub Security Advisories (private reporting)

## Future Considerations

This documentation-first approach scales well:

- **Team Growth** — New team members can onboard quickly
- **AI Evolution** — As AI tools improve, richer context yields better results
- **Knowledge Preservation** — Institutional knowledge is captured, not lost
- **Compliance** — Standards can be audited and verified
- **Tooling** — Documentation can drive automated tooling and checks

## Issue Templates and Community Feedback

The repository uses structured issue templates to facilitate bug reports, feature requests, and documentation improvements:

- **Bug Reports** — Structured form for reporting functional issues with browser/device context
- **Feature Requests** — Template for proposing enhancements with use case and priority assessment
- **Documentation Issues** — Form for reporting documentation gaps or improvements

Issue templates ensure consistency, capture necessary context, and integrate with CI/CD workflows through automatic labeling. Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately through GitHub Security Advisories rather than public issues.

See `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for template definitions and usage guidelines.
