## Introduction

I lead engineering teams and architect frontend platforms that combine composposable architectures, modern frameworks, design systems and Developer Experience (DevEx) workflows. My work focuses on scalable frontend architectures, accessible user experiences, CI/CD automation and cross-functional engineering leadership.

## Professional Summary

At Nexthink I led the global corporate marketing platform built on Next.js, GraphQL, Tailwind CSS and Hygraph on Vercel—driving performance, accessibility and DevEx automation across a distributed engineering team operating in six locales.

At EUROCONTROL I defined the Design System strategy for aviation-critical operations, strengthened CI/CD pipelines and implemented governance frameworks across regulated, mission-critical workflows.

At Carlsberg I built the _Malty_ global React/TypeScript component library, founded the Frontend Community of Practice and scaled cross-market engineering workflows supporting the Western Europe digital ecosystem.

Before transitioning fully into software development, I spent ten years at **Nokia** as an **RF Engineer**, working on network optimization, antenna systems, mobility performance and large-scale wireless deployments—experience that shaped my systems-level approach to architecture, reliability and performance.

My software career began nearly 15 years ago when I co-founded Greygoo, leading web and mobile delivery for clients including GM, NCAA and the Paulson Institute in U.S. markets.

**My mission:** build systems and teams that scale, reduce friction and deliver long-term, repeatable value.
