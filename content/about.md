I'm a Web Engineering Manager and Frontend Architect with over 25 years of experience helping organizations build accessible, scalable, and maintainable digital platforms across enterprise, e-commerce, and mission-critical domains.

My expertise lies in bridging frontend architecture, design systems, and business strategy—enabling fast delivery, consistent experiences, and empowered engineering teams. Whether designing composable web platforms, scaling design systems, or improving Developer Experience (DevEx), I focus on maintainability, clarity, and long-term alignment.

At Nexthink, I led the Web Engineering team behind nexthink.com—the company’s global corporate marketing platform. I oversaw the architecture and delivery of a composable stack built with Next.js, GraphQL, Tailwind CSS, and Hygraph CMS, deployed on Vercel. My work focused on performance, accessibility, and cross‑functional collaboration, managing a lean distributed team while strengthening Developer Experience through automation, clear guardrails, and Community‑of‑Practice (CoP)–driven knowledge sharing.

Previously, at EUROCONTROL, I led frontend governance and modernization for aviation-critical systems within the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC). I defined the vision for the EUROCONTROL Design System (EDS) and introduced developer experience improvements across CI/CD, documentation, and microfrontend frameworks—all while ensuring compliance with safety and regulatory standards.

Earlier, at Carlsberg Group, I architected the Malty Design System, a global React/TypeScript component library powering the company’s B2B and marketing platforms. I also founded Carlsberg’s first Frontend Community of Practice (CoP), fostering shared tooling, code reuse, and scalable engineering culture. My work there bridged design and development, improving delivery velocity, governance, and cross-functional collaboration.

Before that, I co-founded Greygoo, where I led design and delivery of web and mobile solutions for clients such as General Motors, GO GROUND (NCAA), and public-sector institutions. I also contributed to projects across healthcare, e-commerce, and telecommunications—delivering Angular platforms, A/B testing pipelines, and network rollouts for Nokia across the U.S.

I believe in building systems and teams that scale—architectures that enable autonomy, processes that reduce friction, and cultures where knowledge flows freely.

### Core Focus Areas

- **Frontend Architecture & Composable Platforms**  
  I design scalable, maintainable frontend systems using modern frameworks and composable architecture—whether for marketing websites like [nexthink.com](https://nexthink.com) or for design-system-driven ecosystems like Carlsberg's [Malty Design System](https://malty.carlsberggroup.com).

- **Design Systems & UI Consistency**  
  From foundational initiatives like EDS (EUROCONTROL) to enterprise-grade component libraries like Malty (Carlsberg), I architect and lead Design System programs that drive accessibility, consistency, and design-to-code alignment across products and teams.

- **Developer Experience (DevEx) & CI/CD**  
  I focus on automation and workflow optimization—implementing CI/CD pipelines, onboarding frameworks, and AI-assisted tooling to improve delivery velocity, quality, and developer satisfaction.

- **Leadership & Communities of Practice (CoP)**  
  I foster technical alignment, mentorship, cross-functional collaboration, and distributed team leadership through CoPs that scale shared practices, governance, and innovation across global teams.

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
  I work closely with design, product, marketing, and compliance stakeholders to ensure architectural integrity, business impact, and long-term maintainability in every deliverable.

- **Accessibility & Performance**  
  I champion inclusive, high-performance user experiences—meeting WCAG 2.1 standards while optimizing for SEO, responsiveness, and cross-browser reliability.

- **Documentation & Knowledge Management**  
  I maintain architectural and governance documentation through platforms like Confluence and SharePoint—supporting compliance, traceability, and seamless onboarding across teams.
