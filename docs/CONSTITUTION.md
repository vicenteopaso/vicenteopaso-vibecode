# Engineering Constitution

This document defines how this repository is run and maintained.

## Purpose

- Treat this personal site like a well-governed product.
- Make decisions explicit.
- Keep quality high without slowing down iteration.

## Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** — The main branch reflects the canonical state of the site.
2. **Quality Over Volume** — Fewer, higher-quality pages instead of many shallow ones.
3. **Accessibility First** — Features must be keyboard- and screen-reader friendly.
4. **SEO as a Feature** — Structured data, metadata, and performance are first-class.
5. **Continuous Improvement** — Small, frequent improvements beat big rewrites.

## Decision-Making

- Architectural decisions are documented inline in code comments or in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Changes to governance or policies are made via PRs that clearly state intent.

## Change Process

1. Open an issue or write a short rationale in the PR description.
2. Run linting, tests, and accessibility checks locally where possible.
3. Use small, focused PRs that are easy to review.
