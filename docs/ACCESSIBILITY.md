# Accessibility Guidelines

This project targets **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance as a minimum standard.

## Core Principles (POUR)

1. **Perceivable**: Content available to all senses
2. **Operable**: Interface works with keyboard and assistive tech
3. **Understandable**: Content and operation are clear
4. **Robust**: Works across browsers and assistive technologies

## Requirements

### Semantic HTML

- Use semantic elements: `header`, `main`, `nav`, `footer`, `article`, `section`
- Maintain correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
- Use `button` for actions, `a` for navigation
- Use lists (`ul`, `ol`) for list content

### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order following visual layout
- Visible focus indicators (never `outline: none` without alternative)
- No keyboard traps
- Skip links for main content

### Color & Contrast

- Body text: ≥ 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold): ≥ 3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components: ≥ 3:1 contrast ratio
- Never rely on color alone to convey information

#### High Contrast mode (conforming alternate)

The default dark-theme accent red (`#b3141c`, 3.0:1 on black) is deliberately below 4.5:1 for small text. WCAG 2.1 AA for that text comes from High Contrast mode, per technique G174 ([ADR-0003](./adr/0003-high-contrast-mode-conforming-alternate.md)):

- The [ContrastToggle](./components/ContrastToggle.md) in the top navigation is on every page. It's keyboard operable, reports its state with `aria-pressed`, and meets AA contrast itself.
- It switches every page to the High Contrast palette (`<html data-contrast="more">`), which meets AA for all text. The choice persists across pages and visits.
- Visitors whose OS asks for more contrast (`prefers-contrast: more`) get High Contrast automatically until they choose otherwise.
- New colors must meet AA in High Contrast mode in both themes. In the default palette they must meet AA everywhere except small red accent text in the dark theme.

### Images

- Decorative images: `alt=""`
- Informative images: Descriptive alt text
- Complex images: Extended description via `aria-describedby`
- Use Next.js `Image` component for optimization

### Forms

- Labels associated with inputs (`htmlFor` or wrapping)
- Error messages linked to inputs
- Clear validation feedback
- Accessible placeholders (not as label replacement)

### ARIA

- Use only when native HTML is insufficient
- Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA
- Common patterns:
  - `aria-label` for icon buttons
  - `aria-expanded` for expandable content
  - `aria-live` for dynamic content
  - `role="dialog"` with proper focus management

## Implementation

### Components

All UI components in `app/components/` must:

- Support keyboard interaction
- Have appropriate ARIA attributes
- Maintain focus correctly
- Work with screen readers

### Testing

**Automated:**

- `pnpm lint` includes `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
- `scripts/audit-a11y.mjs` checks image alt text (fast, no build required — runs in `.github/workflows/accessibility.yml`)
- `pnpm test:a11y` (`test/a11y/`) runs against the built app in CI's Build & Verify job:
  - `axe.spec.ts`: full `axe-core` scan tagged to WCAG 2.1 A/AA (contrast, ARIA, labels, heading order, landmarks, link names, etc.) across every route and both locales, in four presentations: light, dark, and both themes in High Contrast mode. Color contrast is checked everywhere except the default dark palette (see High Contrast mode above). On every page, the High Contrast toggle must be present and pass the scan itself.
  - `typography.spec.ts`: reflow at 320px width (WCAG 1.4.10) and the WCAG 1.4.12 text-spacing override check are hard gates; font size, line-height, and font-weight are advisory (non-blocking) warnings, since the site's design intentionally uses small mono labels/meta text in places
- Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 90

**Manual (required for PRs):**

- Keyboard-only navigation test
- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver/NVDA)
- Color contrast verification
- Focus management verification

### Tools

- ESLint: `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` (enforced)
- Lighthouse: Accessibility audits
- axe DevTools: Browser extension
- WAVE: Web accessibility evaluator

## Forbidden Patterns

Never:

- Remove or hide focus indicators
- Use `tabindex > 0`
- Create keyboard traps
- Use non-semantic elements for interactive content
- Skip heading levels
- Use color alone for information
- Remove alt text from informative images
