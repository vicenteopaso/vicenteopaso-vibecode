# Support

GitHub Issues are enabled for this repository and should be used for **non-sensitive bugs, feature requests, and documentation improvements**.

- For general questions or feedback: you can either open a GitHub Issue or email **vicente@opa.so**.
- For security reports: see `SECURITY.md` and email privately instead of opening an Issue.
- For contributions and fixes: open a **Pull Request** (PRs are welcome).

## Expectations

- This is a personal site; responses are best-effort, typically within a few days.
- Please ensure PRs:
- - Pass CI (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm test:e2e` where relevant).
- Follow the PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
